## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New File
- **`SplashScreen.kt`** - Complete splash screen implementation
  - Location: `app/src/main/java/com/kreggscode/zodiacfinder/ui/screens/`
  - Size: ~250 lines
  - Fully animated with Jetpack Compose

### Modified File
- **`MainActivity.kt`** - Added splash screen logic
  - Shows splash screen on app launch
  - Automatically transitions to main screen after 2.5 seconds
  - Uses state management for smooth transition

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Implementation Flow
```kotlin
1. App Launches
   ↓
2. MainActivity onCreate()
   ↓
3. showSplash = true (initial state)
   ↓
4. SplashScreen composable displays
   ↓
5. Animations start automatically
   ↓
6. After 2.5 seconds: onSplashFinished()
   ↓
7. showSplash = false
   ↓
8. MainScreen displays (app content)
```

### State Management
```kotlin
var showSplash by remember { mutableStateOf(true) }

if (showSplash) {
    SplashScreen(onSplashFinished = { showSplash = false })
} else {
    MainScreen(...)
}
```

- **Animation**: Sequential pulse
- **Delay**: 200ms between each
- **Scale**: 0.8x → 1.2x
- **Alpha**: 0.3 → 1.0
- **Color**: Lucky Gold gradient

### 4. Text Elements
- **Fade In**: 0 → 1 (1 second)
- **Scale**: 0.5x → 1.0x (spring)
- **Timing**: Synchronized with icon

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Duration
In `SplashScreen.kt`, line 19:
```kotlin
delay(2500) // Change to desired milliseconds
// 2000 = 2 seconds
// 3000 = 3 seconds
```

### Change Icon
Line 107:
```kotlin
Text(
    text = "🔮", // Change to any emoji
    fontSize = 120.sp
)
```

**Suggested alternatives**:

- ✨ Sparkles
- 🌟 Glowing Star
- ♈ Zodiac Symbol

### Change Colors
Modify gradient colors (lines 57-64):
```kotlin
colors = listOf(
    Color(0xFF0f0f23), // Change these hex colors
    Color(0xFF1a1a2e),
    Color(0xFF16213e),
    Color(0xFF0f0f23)
)
```

### Change App Name
Line 117:
```kotlin
Text(
    text = "ZodiacAI Finder", // Change app name
    fontSize = 32.sp
)
```

### Change Tagline
Line 125:
```kotlin

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Splash screen doesn't show
- Check `MainActivity.kt` has `showSplash` state
- Verify `SplashScreen` import is correct
- Clean and rebuild project

### Animations are laggy
- Test on physical device (emulator may be slow)
- Reduce number of stars (change `repeat(30)` to lower number)
- Increase animation duration for smoother effect

### Splash shows too long/short
- Adjust `delay(2500)` value in `SplashScreen.kt`
- Recommended range: 1500-3000 milliseconds

### Colors don't match
- Use exact color values from `Theme.kt`
- Check color alpha values
- Test on different screen brightness
